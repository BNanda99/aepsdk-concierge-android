/**
 * App-owned F&B coordination across card instances; the SDK holds no menu or order state.
 *
 * - UI state (kept here, never sent): which menus checkout closed.
 * - Current and past order IDs are mirrored into `_sacramentokings.conciergeContext.fnbOrders` through
 *   [publishContext]; order-status tracking stays app-local.
 *
 * Which card is newest comes from the SDK's `isLatest` context flag, never from display order:
 * Compose doesn't compose transcript rows in transcript order, so a card that displays later can
 * be older. Cards register on first display. The store is memory-only and resets when a newly
 * displayed card belongs to another Concierge session,
 * matching the SDK, which drops held XDM context for a new session. Checkout only archives the
 * order as `pending`: opening checkout proves neither payment nor fulfillment.
